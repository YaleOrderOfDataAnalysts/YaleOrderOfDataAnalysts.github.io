### Planning

- Consider inviting Yale-NUS students to start their own chapter; we could
have friendly competitions?

- Inviting other Yalies

- Officers?

- Other ideas or brainstorming?

- Planning?  A sense of "closure" as we try things?  Requests?  Offers to organize
an evening?

### Sarah Ditchek's improve course scrape

We could go through this and then have a graphics challenge.  What would be
nice is something like [this page](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/2013-14/FALL2013-14.png).  We played with a
[toy version](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jay/dataclub/samplecourses.csv)
of a course database for
the purpose of playing with the graphics:

### Graphics

```{r}
x <- read.csv("samplecourses.csv", as.is=TRUE)

library(grid)

grid.newpage()
pushViewport(viewport(x=0.1, y=0.1, w=0.8, h=0.8,
                      just=c("left","bottom"),
                      xscale=c(0.5, 5.5),
                      yscale=c(18, 9)))
grid.xaxis(at=1:5, main=FALSE,
           label=c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"))
grid.xaxis(at=1:5, main=TRUE,
           label=c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"))
grid.yaxis(at=9:18, main=TRUE,
           label=paste(9:18, ":00", sep=""))
grid.yaxis(at=9:18, main=FALSE,
           label=paste(9:18, ":00", sep=""))
grid.rect()
grid.segments(x0=unit(seq(1.5,4.5,1), "native"),
              y0=unit(rep(0,4), "npc"),
              x1=unit(seq(1.5,4.5,1), "native"),
              y1=unit(rep(1,4), "npc"), 
              gp=gpar(col="green"))

for (i in 1:nrow(x)) {
  for (d in 1:5) {
    if (x[i,d+2]==1) {
      xloc <- x[i,d+2] * d
      yloc <- (x$end[i] + x$start[i]) / 2
      h <- x$end[i] - x$start[i]
      grid.rect(unit(xloc, "native"), unit(yloc, "native"), 
                width=unit(0.9, "native"),
                height=unit(h, "native"))
      grid.text(x$course[i], unit(xloc, "native"),
                unit(yloc - 0.1, "native"), gp=gpar(cex=0.7))
      grid.text(x$room[i], unit(xloc, "native"),
                unit(yloc + 0.1, "native"), gp=gpar(cex=0.7))
    }
  }
}

popViewport(1)

```
