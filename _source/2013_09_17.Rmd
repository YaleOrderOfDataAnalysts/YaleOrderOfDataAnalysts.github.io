### Planning

- Consider inviting Yale-NUS students to start their own chapter; we could
have friendly competitions?

- Inviting other Yalies

- Officers?

- Other ideas or brainstorming?

- Planning?  A sense of "closure" as we try things?  Requests?  Offers to organize
an evening?

We could go through this and then have a graphics challenge.  What would be
nice is something like [this page](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/2013-14/FALL2013-14.png).
