### Github and web page basics

Minutes are limited.  Everyone created a Github account and
authored basic HTML pages.  Then Jay demonstrated the integration
of HTML produced from R Markdown (Rmd) with a template having nice
CSS.  A basic folder of this example is available
[here](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jay/dataclub/).
