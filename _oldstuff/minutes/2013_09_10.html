<h1>&ldquo;Data Club&rdquo; Meeting 9/10/2013</h1>
<p>After a range of opening conversations, Jay went to work trying
to get an image of a Google Map, while the others took on the
<a href="WhatWouldHartiganDo%20April%206,%202013">http://whatwouldhartigando.com</a>
image processing challenge.  The following worked at the meeting
but won&#39;t work now (probably a stale cookie):</p>
<pre><code class="r">x &lt;- scan(&quot;https://maps.google.com/?ll=41.306956,-72.926044&amp;spn=0.035977,0.076389&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;layer=t&quot;, 
    what = &quot;&quot;, sep = &quot;\n&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>We thought it would be really cool if we could do some image
processing to get traffic congestion for New Haven &ndash; if we
could get the Google Traffic Map as an image.</p>
<p>Jay&#39;s part of this didn&#39;t work out.  There are various tools on the
web for converting web pages to images, but these weren&#39;t terribly
well-supported or well-documented.  The official Google API doesn&#39;t
support static maps with traffic congestion overlay, unfortunately.</p>
<p>We concluded with plans to survey folks for the &ldquo;final&rdquo; group name
and meeting time.</p>
<h3>Addendum from Jay</h3>
<p>The result of this survey lead to the Yale Order of Data Analysis
(YODA) and this Github organization and web pages.  As of this note,
the official meeting time will be Tuesday, 8 PM, in the TEAL classroom
of 24 Hillhouse Avenue.</p>
