<h1>&ldquo;Data Club&rdquo;</h1>
<p>This document serves as the minutes from the first meeting of
the first chapter of &ldquo;Data Club&rdquo; &ndash; name still to be determined &ndash;
which took place on September 3, 2013 in the Department of Statistics
at Yale University.
The following individuals were present, in no particular order:</p>
<pre><code>Jay Emerson, Jessica Landau-Taylor, Jacob Rosenberg-Wohl,
Tammy Pham, John Park, Sarah Ditchek, Rosie Buchanan,
Gaby Garbasz, Sharon Qian, Jessica Allen, Geoffrey Litt,
Stephanie Adcock, Daniel Noble, Kishen Patel, Henry Davidge
</code></pre>
<p>Our motivation?  Mathematics + Statistics + Computer Science + Engineering =
Data Science (more or less, using terms loosely)?</p>

<h3>Possible agenda items</h3>
<p>We touched upon most of the following items, but the meeting was informal.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Agree upon an agenda.  <strong>We never managed this.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>What are people interested in?  <strong>We made some headway, summarized below.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>My involvement can range from minimal to substantial.  I doubt anybody
wants &ldquo;yet-another-lecture&rdquo; and I don&#39;t really want to prepare them.  But
there certainly are things that I can present with minimal preparation as
needed.  There are certainly things I&#39;d like to know more about.  For example,
I bet someone here could offer a crash mini-course on Python.
<strong>We discussed this.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do we need rules?  &ldquo;Don&#39;t talk about Data Club&rdquo; might not make any sense.
<strong>We didn&#39;t discuss this and I didn&#39;t get the sense that there was any reason
to do so.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Should there be weekly meetings?  Bi-weekly?  Monthly? At regular
times, or scheduled one-by-one?  <strong>Weekly meetings will be planned.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The Department of Statistics has a course web page at 
<a href="http://statistics.yale.edu/courses">http://statistics.yale.edu/courses</a>.  You can&#39;t see it by default,
but the page source contains days and meeting times.  We&#39;d like
to automatically produce a graphical display of the course meeting
times. <strong>We tried a scrape (limited progress shown below).</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Google Code Jam.  Here&#39;s a simple example.  We could budget 30 minutes
and try working (individually or in pairs):
<a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/2270488/dashboard#s=p1">http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/2270488/dashboard#s=p1</a>
<strong>We glanced at two of them but didn&#39;t work on anything.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>.  Yes, they have competitions we could
look at.  But I&#39;d
like to have my own &ldquo;poor man&#39;s Kaggle&rdquo; platform for use in my own courses.
My instinct is to build this as a Shiny application in R.  You may have never
heard of Shiny, so trust me: it&#39;s pretty damn cool.  I&#39;m also
interested in data analysis problems that would be well-suited for in-class
competitions or homework using this platform.
<strong>I talked a little about this but we didn&#39;t look at anything on Kaggle.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Location?  I&#39;m thinking the TEAL classroom would be cool.  Though 24 HH has some nice advantages (if we fit and if it is available).
<strong>People agreed that TEAL was a good location.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Yale Stats Course Scrape</h3>
<pre><code class="r">thisurl &lt;- &quot;http://statistics.yale.edu/courses&quot;
x &lt;- scan(thisurl, what = &quot;&quot;, sep = &quot;\n&quot;)
tlines &lt;- grep(&quot;views-accordion-courses-page_2-header&quot;, x)[-1]
dtlines &lt;- grep(&quot;Day/Time&quot;, x)
titles &lt;- substring(x[tlines + 1], 5, 12)
tlines &lt;- tlines[substring(titles, 6, 6) != 1]
titles &lt;- substring(x[tlines + 1], 5, 12)
tlines &lt;- tlines[!duplicated(titles)]
titles &lt;- substring(x[tlines + 1], 5, 12)
dt &lt;- x[tlines + 9]
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we realized that gathering the day/time information was going to be
a problem given our initial approach.  Jay commented that he would at this point
start over rather than try to modify this scrape further.</p>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Jay will explore TEAL availability and will organize a Doodle poll to determine
a regular meeting time.</p></li>
<li><p>Jessica is very interested in a &ldquo;Yale Blue Line&rdquo; data scrape.  Jay pointed out that
some latitude/longitude information is imbedded in the web pages.</p></li>
<li><p>We agreed that there seemed to be a general divide of activities into &ldquo;crash courses&rdquo;
(such as a crash course in Python) and &ldquo;fun stuff&rdquo; (like Jessica&#39;s proposed scrape, above).
This seems like a reasonable way to proceed with the planning.</p></li>
<li><p>A list of possible topics for &ldquo;crash courses&rdquo; included: Python, C (including
authoring R packages and the C interface), Linux, shell scripting, and web technologies
(FastRWeb, Shiny, classic CGI scripting, etc&hellip;).</p></li>
<li><p>We need a name!  Once we have a name I&#39;d put up a Github repository.</p></li>
